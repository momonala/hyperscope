# To Do

## Software 
### Image Stitching
- cascade stitches in horizontal batches until final image is reached
    - write an automated algo for this
- test on maximum zoom level

### Firmware
- Get serial input working reliably
- OR predetermine X,Y range of slide, and automaticaly scan across 
    - no serial input needed

## Hardware
### Stage Automation
- determine when bounds hit on stage
- print motor-stage interface - timing belts

### Focus Automation
- print motor mounts for focus rings

# Later 

### AutoFocus
- determine if image is in focus or not, go to right spot if not

### Object Tracking for live cells
- follow a specific sample around (OpenCV Tracking lib)
- selected ROIs (requires GUI)
